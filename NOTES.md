PREFACE
Prior to this task, I had no experience with docker, so I learnt a lot very quickly.
First time using GitHub Actions too.

RUNNING DOCKER IMAGE
CMD: "docker run -p 80:80 tech-challenge"

The container will need to be run with the above command, I can expose the ports in the dockerfile but I cannot publish them, hence the command above.
The expose command in the dockerfile does not expose the containerâ€™s ports to be accessible from the host, it only makes the stated ports available for inter-container interaction.

RUN BROWSER
To access, enter the url "localhost/ping"
